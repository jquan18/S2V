Dynamic Trust Management in 5G Vehicular Networks using Federated Learning and Blockchain

# Dynamic Trust Management Using Federated Learning and Blockchain in 5G Vehicular Networks

## Concept Overview
This project integrates **Federated Learning (FL)** and **Solana blockchain** to manage trust in 5G-enabled vehicular networks. The system adjusts the trust level of vehicles dynamically based on their behavior and contributions, ensuring that shared data is reliable. Malicious or faulty vehicles are identified and excluded from the network, improving overall safety and efficiency.

## Key Components

1. **Federated Learning for Trust Management**:
   - **Local Learning**: Each vehicle trains a local machine learning model using its own data (e.g., driving behavior, interactions with other vehicles). The model learns to assess trustworthiness based on this data.
   - **Model Updates**: Vehicles share updates from their local models (e.g., changes in weights or gradients) with the network, preserving privacy while enabling collective learning.

2. **Blockchain for Validation and Consensus**:
   - **Smart Contracts**: Solana smart contracts validate the model updates and aggregate them to create a global model reflecting the trustworthiness of vehicles across the network.
   - **Decentralized Trust Scores**: The blockchain maintains dynamic trust scores for each vehicle, which affects how other vehicles interact with it.

3. **Dynamic Trust Adjustment**:
   - **Real-Time Updates**: Vehicles' trust scores are updated continuously based on their behavior, affecting how other vehicles use their data.
   - **Access Control**: Vehicles with higher trust scores may be given privileges (e.g., leading communication), while low-trust vehicles could face restrictions.

4. **Incentivization and Penalties**:
   - **Reward Mechanism**: Trustworthy vehicles can earn rewards (e.g., tokens) that can be used for benefits like access to premium services or discounts.
   - **Penalization**: Malicious or faulty vehicles may see their trust scores reduced, potentially leading to penalties like network exclusion.

## User Flow (Driver-Side Experience)

1. **On-the-Road Learning**: Vehicles continuously collect data about driving behavior, interactions with others, and road conditions.
2. **Trust Score Influence**: Good driving behavior improves trust scores, while suspicious or reckless driving lowers them.
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Trust scores are updated in real-time and shared with nearby vehicles via Solana blockchain.
4. **Incentives**: High-trust vehicles may earn rewards, such as lower insurance rates or access to premium services.

## Backend Flow (Developer/Administrator Perspective)

1. **Federated Learning Integration**: Deploy federated learning models on participating vehicles. Each vehicle trains its local model and periodically sends model updates to the blockchain.
2. **Smart Contract Validation**: Solana smart contracts validate model updates and aggregate them to adjust global trust scores.
3. **Trust Score Management**: Trust scores for each vehicle are maintained and updated on the blockchain, influencing privileges and data sharing rights.
4. **Security and Scalability**: Solana's high-throughput, low-latency blockchain ensures fast, secure, and scalable trust management.

## Revenue Generation

1. **Premium Services**: Offer collision detection and trust management features through a subscription service for drivers and fleet operators.
2. **Insurance Partnerships**: Provide usage-based insurance plans, offering discounts for drivers with higher trust scores.
3. **Data Monetization**: Sell anonymized driving behavior data and trust score analytics to third parties, such as automotive companies and safety organizations.
4. **Fleet Management Solutions**: Offer fleet operators safety and trust management services, reducing accidents and optimizing vehicle performance.

## System Architecture

- **Federated Learning**: Ensures privacy by sharing model updates instead of raw data.
- **Solana Blockchain**: Provides decentralized, transparent validation and trust score management.
- **Smart Contracts**: Enforce rules for trust management and data validation.
- **Rewards System**: High-trust vehicles are incentivized with tokens, fostering safe driving behavior.
